# MSPN_privacy


## Summary

Simulation code to explore MSPNs as private representations of data

This repository includes the code used for the paper "Generating synthetic mixed discrete-continuous health records with mixed sum-product networks" by Kroes, van Leeuwen, Groenwold and Janssen. In the paper we evaluate whether data generated from MSPNs can be used as an anonymized substitute for original data in various regression analysis scenarios. We measure whether the regression parameter for a variable of interest is measured accurately and precisely and we use interpretable measures of privacy to evaluate whether the data generated by the MSPN can be considered anonymized. 

The folder source contains all the functions required to run the simulations and to anonymize data. In particular, the file anonymize_data.py is created for external users who want to apply the anonymization approach to their own data, including a small example. 

The results folder contains all the result objects and the code to analyze these objects. The folder "scripts" contains the code with which these results were generated.
