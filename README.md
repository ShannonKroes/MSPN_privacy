Simulation code to explore MSPNs as private representations of data

This repository includes the code used for the paper "Exploring Mixed Sum-Product Networks as private representations of data". In the paper we present simulation results, where we evaluate whether data generated from MSPNs can be used as an anonymized substitute for original data in various regression analysis scenarios. We measure whether the regression parameter for a variable of interest is measured accurately and precisely and we use interpretable measures of privacy to evaluate whether the data generated by the MSPN can be considered anonymized. 

The file all_functions.py includes all the functions used for the simulation and can be divided into 1. generating data, 2. evaluating privacy, 3. running the simulation (which is also with the goal of measuring information loss) and 4. printing results. 

The file test_simulation.py includes code to test the simulation code on your own device.

The file results.py includes the code that was run to test the simulations, where we make a distinction between the code needed for table 1 and 2 in the final paper.

The file compute_evars.py contains the code used to compute the error variance needed for R2 of 0.3.
